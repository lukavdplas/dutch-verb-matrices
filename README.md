# Dutch verb matrices
Code used to train and analyse distributional Dutch verb matrices, created for my [bachelor thesis](https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/375639).

The trained verb matrices are included, as well as the database of relative clauses used to test them.

Since each python file corresponds to one step in the analysis, it is recommended to keep in mind the order in which these steps were performed when reviewing the code. See the [file overview](./file-overview.pdf) for a comprehensive graph of the dependencies between the python files.
